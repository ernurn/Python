# Python

I am currently learning Python with the goal of applying it to automations in SRE (Site Reliability Engineering). This language will allow me to optimize repetitive tasks, create efficient scripts, and improve infrastructure management.

## Learning Resources

I am basing my study on the following resources:

1. [W3Schools - Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python)  
   This tutorial provides a solid foundation in Python, from basic to advanced concepts.

2. [mouredev/Hello-Python](https://github.com/mouredev/Hello-Python?tab=readme-ov-file)  
   An excellent repository that helps me improve my skills through practical exercises and small projects.

3. [Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python)  
   This 30-day course is a great guide, covering a wide range of topics from fundamentals to more complex applications.

## Future Applications

I plan to use Python to automate processes in my daily work as an SRE, focusing on infrastructure optimization, server and network management, and creating tools that facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting.
